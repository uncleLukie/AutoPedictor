# AutoPredictor

## What is it?

A solidity contract using OpenZeppelin to create a prediction system where players can predict a win or loss with Ethereum and the owner of the contract can set the result, payout or refund the players.

## How it works

## Status
payout() does not work, my guess is that the math is not correc. In testing the owner gets an exception when he calls the function.
